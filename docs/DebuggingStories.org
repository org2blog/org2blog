* Debugging Stories

Over the years various issues have surfaced. Most of them weren't worth
mentioning because they were to small. But some of them were big that they
deserved getting written down here!

After studying how debugging works you might enjoy seeing the outcome of an
example or two.

** Can't Post Unicode

Suddenly Org2Blog couldn't post any content that contained Unicode characters.
The problem was that when Emacs 26 came out its HTTP request library began
enforcing correct byte usage for Unicode. The library itself worked fine.
However clients of the library had to change. The solution was nearly a
[[https://github.com/hexmode/xml-rpc-el/commit/8ee416cb7644eef4ca8edda5ea79b1c670555ad0][one line fix]].

** Inexplicably Can't Login Or Do Anything

For years everything was fine using Org2Blog, it just worked on my box. Then
once in a while it didn't. And then it only worked one time out of ten. This
was a major issue.

After testing every combination of every library nothing obvious jumps out.
Finally I pull out WireShark and curl to see what is happening.

Take a look—

Here is what it looks like when it /doesn't/ work using Org2Blog:

Here is what it looks like when it /does/ work using curl:

Debugging at the communications layer was an absolute last resort—and it
payed off. Unbeknownst to me the TLS version used is negotiated between the client
and the server. For some reason my GnuTLS was negotiating v1.3 with the server
and puked resulting it sending everything unencrypted over HTTP instead of
encrypted over HTTPS!

The solution was pretty simple: forbid GnuTLS from using TLSv1.3 this as
seen in the README

What caused the problem by who where? I don't know. What I can tell you though
is that the timing of when issue presented itself was pretty close to when
TLSv1.3 was nearly standardized and a lot of servers were switching over to
using it. Maybe the host I was using was slowly cutting sites over to it? I'm
just happy it works correctly now.
