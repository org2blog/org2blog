* Overview
  org2blog is a tool to publish directly from Emacs' org-mode to
  [[http://wordpress.org/][WordPress]] blogs.  

  It is inspired by and based on a [[http://paste.lisp.org/display/69993][wordpress posting client for
  muse-mode]] written by [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AshishShukla][Ashish Shukla]].  

  org2blog is licensed under GPLv3

* Installation

  Download org2blog from github

  : git clone http://github.com/punchagan/org2blog.git
  
  Add the org2blog directory to your load path and then add

  : (setq load-path (cons "~/.emacs.d/org2blog/" load-path))
  : (require 'org2blog)

  to your dot emacs.  

*** Dependencies
    1. org2blog depends on /xml-rpc/ available at [[http://launchpad.net/xml-rpc-el][Launchpad]].  Add it
       to your /load-path/ before using org2blog.

    2. Make sure you have the latest org-mode installed. org2blog may
       not work with older versions of org. 

* Usage
*** Defining your blog setup
    You can optionally save the xmlrpc url of your blog and the username.

    : (setq org2blog-blog-alist
    :       '(("wordpress"
    :          :url "http://username.wordpress.com/xmlrpc.php"
    :          :username "username"   
    :          :default-title "Hello World"
    :          :default-categories ("org2blog" "emacs")
    :          :tags-as-categories nil)
    :         ("my-blog"             
    :          :url "http://username.server.com/xmlrpc.php"
    :          :username "admin")))
    
    The variables in the =plist= set for each blog over-ride the
    global values of the corresponding variables. =url= and =username=
    are mandatory variables. Others are optional.

    If you use only categories, set the org2blog-use-tags-as-categories
    variable. 

    : (setq org2blog-use-tags-as-categories t)

    If you wish to be asked for confirmation before publishing a post,
    set the variable =org2blog-confirm-post=. 
   
    To browse or customize other variables use the customize group
    function.

    : M-x customize-group org2blog RET

*** Logging In 
    Use *M-x org2blog-login*.  Provide xmlrpc url, username, password
    and blog-id. (blog-id isn't really being used.)  Optionally, you
    could set these in your .emacs.
     
*** Writing a new post 
    Use *M-x org2blog-new-entry*. 
     - Tags and Categories are comma or space separated values.
       Completion (for both) is triggered using *C-c t*.  If a new
       category is used you will be prompted before adding it.  
     - The excerpt for a post can be written as =#+DESCRIPTION=.
     - The parent for a page can be specified using =#+PARENT=.\\ *C-c
       t* again provides completion for the page name.

*** Publishing 
    | post buffer as draft      | *C-c d* | *M-x     org2blog-post-buffer*         |
    | publish buffer            | *C-c p* | *C-u M-x org2blog-post-buffer*         |
    | post buffer as page draft | *C-c D* | *M-x     org2blog-post-buffer-as-page* |
    | publish buffer as page    | *C-c P* | *C-u M-x org2blog-post-buffer-as-page* |

*** Post your existing org-files too
    - Add =#+TITLE=, =#+OPTIONS=, =#+TAGS=, =#+CATEGORY=,
          =#+DESCRIPTION=, =#+DATE=, to your file.  (All of these are
      Optional)
    - Add a =#+POSTID= to edit an existing post.
    - Post buffer using the function names, as above. 
    
*** Posting a subtree
    - Use *M-x   org2blog-post-subtree*.
    - Tags of the subtree will be used for tags. Other properties can
      be set using a property drawer.

*** Delete an entry or a page
    - If you are in the buffer of the entry/page, with =#+POSTID=
      present on the page, use :\\
        *M-x org2blog-delete-entry* or *M-x  org2blog-delete-page*
    - If you want to delete a particular post (whose post-id is
        known) from any buffer, use\\ 
        *C-u post-id   M-x org2blog-delete-entry*.  
      
    Similarly, for a page.

*** Enabling org2blog mode (defines key-bindings)
    - use *M-x org2blog-mode*.  
      This defines the following the key-bindings:
      | *C-c p* | publish buffer                   |
      | *C-c d* | post as draft                    |
      | *C-c t* | complete tag or parent page name |
