* Overview
  org2blog/wp is a tool to publish directly from Emacs' org-mode to
  [[http://wordpress.org/][WordPress]] blogs.  org2blog/wp is one of the two packages named
  org2blog.  The other is [[http://repo.or.cz/r/org2blog.git/][org2blog/atom]] by [[http://tehom-blog.blogspot.com/][Tom Breton]]. 

  org2blog/wp should, /ideally/, work with any platform that supports
  xml-rpc but some of wordpress specific features may not work.

  org2blog was inspired by and based on a [[http://paste.lisp.org/display/69993][wordpress posting client for
  muse-mode]] written by [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AshishShukla][Ashish Shukla]].  

  org2blog is licensed under GPLv3

* Installation

  Download org2blog from github

  : git clone http://github.com/punchagan/org2blog.git
  
  Add the org2blog directory to your load path and then add

  : (setq load-path (cons "~/.emacs.d/org2blog/" load-path))
  : (require 'org2blog)

  to your dot emacs.  

*** Dependencies
    1. org2blog depends on /xml-rpc/ available at [[http://launchpad.net/xml-rpc-el][Launchpad]].  Add it
       to your /load-path/ before using org2blog.

    2. Make sure you have the latest org-mode installed. org2blog may
       not work with older versions of org. 
       
* Usage
*** Defining your blog setup
    
    *Note* - This setup works only for org2blog version >=0.3. For
     lower versions of org2blog check an README from the commit
     e37126eec24ffdd785d2 
   
    You can (should) tell org2blog where your blogs are and optionally
    specify different values for some options. This is done by
    customising the variable =org2blog/wp-blog-alist=.

    For example:
    : (setq org2blog/wp-blog-alist
    :       '(("wordpress"
    :          :url "http://username.wordpress.com/xmlrpc.php"
    :          :username "username"   
    :          :default-title "Hello World"
    :          :default-categories ("org2blog" "emacs")
    :          :tags-as-categories nil)
    :         ("my-blog"             
    :          :url "http://username.server.com/xmlrpc.php"
    :          :username "admin")))
    
    This defines two blogs identified by the terms =wordpress= and
    =my-blog=.
    
    The variables in the =plist= set for each blog over-ride the
    global values of the corresponding variables. =url= and =username=
    are mandatory variables. Others are optional. If you customize the
    variable =org2blog/wp-blog-alist= there is detail information about the
    meaning of each property.

    If you use only categories, set the org2blog/wp-use-tags-as-categories
    variable. 

    : (setq org2blog/wp-use-tags-as-categories t)

    If you wish to be asked for confirmation before publishing a post,
    set the variable =org2blog/wp-confirm-post=. 
   
    To browse or customize other variables use the customize group
    function.

    : M-x customize-group org2blog RET

*** Logging In 
    Use *M-x org2blog/wp-login*.  This function ask you for the name of one
    of the blogs you have configured in the org2blog/wp-blog-alist
    variable described above and will ask for your password. The
    counterpart of this function is *M-x org2blog/wp-logout*, which will
    log you out of the active blog.
     
*** Writing a new post 
    Use *M-x org2blog/wp-new-entry*. 
     - Tags and Categories are comma or space separated values.
       Completion (for both) is triggered using *C-c t*.  If a new
       category is used you will be prompted before adding it.  
     - The excerpt for a post can be written as =#+DESCRIPTION=.
     - The parent for a page can be specified using =#+PARENT=.\\ *C-c
       t* again provides completion for the page name.

*** Publishing 
    | post buffer as draft      | *C-c d* | *M-x     org2blog/wp-post-buffer*         |
    | publish buffer            | *C-c p* | *C-u M-x org2blog/wp-post-buffer*         |
    | post buffer as page draft | *C-c D* | *M-x     org2blog/wp-post-buffer-as-page* |
    | publish buffer as page    | *C-c P* | *C-u M-x org2blog/wp-post-buffer-as-page* |

*** Post your existing org-files too
    - Add =#+TITLE=, =#+OPTIONS=, =#+TAGS=, =#+CATEGORY=,
          =#+DESCRIPTION=, =#+DATE=, to your file.  (All of these are
      Optional)
    - Add a =#+POSTID= to edit an existing post.
    - Post buffer using the function names, as above. 
    
*** Posting a subtree
    - Use *M-x   org2blog/wp-post-subtree*.
    - Tags of the subtree will be used for tags. Other properties can
      be set using a property drawer.

*** Delete an entry or a page
    - If you are in the buffer of the entry/page, with =#+POSTID=
      present on the page, use :\\
        *M-x org2blog/wp-delete-entry* or *M-x  org2blog/wp-delete-page*
    - If you want to delete a particular post (whose post-id is
        known) from any buffer, use\\ 
        *C-u post-id   M-x org2blog/wp-delete-entry*.  
      
    Similarly, for a page.

*** Enabling org2blog mode (defines key-bindings)
    - use *M-x org2blog/wp-mode*.  
      This defines the following the key-bindings:
      | *C-c p* | publish buffer                   |
      | *C-c d* | post as draft                    |
      | *C-c t* | complete tag or parent page name |

*** Uploading Images
    In-line images and linked images with file:// urls (e.g.,
    ~[[file:///path.to.jpeg]]~ or ~[[file:///path.to.jpeg][this is an image link]]~ will be uploaded to
    the media library and the links will be updated. Captions and
    attributes as [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Images-in-HTML-export.html][defined]] in org-mode will be preserved, but at
    present these attributes are not saved with the image to the
    library itself. [Information about uploaded files are added as a
    comment to the post itself, to prevent repeated uploads, but this
    isn't as stable as I would like it.]

* Miscellaneous 
  1. You may want to look at the [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Export-options.html#Export-options][Export options]] and [[http://orgmode.org/manual/HTML-export.html#HTML-export][HTML export]]
     sections of the org-manual.

     use it and on what blog. I'd love to hear from you!

  5. Now, that org2blog does have a bunch of users, I'd like to keep
     track of the blogs it's being used on. :) Feel free to add your
     site to the list of sites using org2blog, on the [[https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog/wiki/Blogs-using-org2blog][wiki]] at github.
